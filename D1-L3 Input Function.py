#LESSON 3 - DAY 1 - INPUT FUNCTION (Note: LESSON 2 was skipped)

#TASK - Write a program that prints the number of characters in a person's name, using the input "Ashley" (The len function counts the number of characters in a string)

#TIP: if we’re asking user to enter a value or string, we need to use the INPUT function
#TIP: Break down into smaller tasks.

#(1) Ask user for input (i.e. their name) & (2) Assigning a variable for the input (below we are using the variable ‘name’)
name=input("What is your name?")

#(3)Determining length of string using len() function & (4) Incorporate everything into a print statement.
print (len(name))
